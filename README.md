# Game-problem
## Time complexity 
1-FindFirst2DArray() has two nested loops that why this function complexity is O(n*2) where n is the size of the input array 
2-MergeAndsort() is used to convert the 2D array into a single array and then sort it so this is have time complexity is O(nlogn)
3-last one findDoubleTarget() also have two nested loops so this also has time complexity O(n*2) where n is the size of the input array
## space complexity
1-The Space complecity of FindFirst2DArray O(1) because it only uses a fixed amount of additional space to store the result array,
redardless of the input size
2-The "mergeand Sort' function creates anew array to store the merged and sorted array. The space complexityh ofthis functio is O(n) 
where n is the total size of the merged array 
3-The FindDoubleTArget functio also creates a new array to store the result the space compxity of this function is o(n) where n is
the size of the input array
